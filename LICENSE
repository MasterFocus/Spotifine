"SPOTIFINE" IS LICENSED UNDER "GNU AGPL v3"

As usual, all my code (unless differently specified) is licensed under GNU AGPL v3.
Here's a very quick, interactive guide if you don't want to read a lot:
- masterfocus.ahk4.net/AGPL_guide.html

You should also refer to at least one of my following personal links when reproducing any code:
- https://github.com/MasterFocus
- http://masterfocus.ahk4.net OR http://mf.pwnz.org OR http://mf.uk.to
- https://sites.google.com/site/masterfocusahk/

Although it's not really necessary, I'd appreciate if you contact me when using my code. :)
